# deepRL

## ToDo list (tentatively sorted by priority)
-[x] Preliminary table of content for the litterature review
-[x] Ran the Argos3 example simulations
-[x] Summarize the papers found
-[ ] Retry to run tensorswarm
-[ ] Start writing the report
-[ ] Continue reading/ watching lecture on DRL
-[ ] Continue research on how to move away from hardware
