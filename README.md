http://wiki.ros.org/openai_ros#Turtlebot2
- [x] Test out navigation without collision using SLAM and using Lidar in ROS and Gazebo
- [x] Computer Vision in robotics- Test out image recogntion from a camera attached on a robot in ROS/Gazebo
- [X] Test out the turtlebot tutorial with DQN: travel to a target location and travel to a target location whhile avoiding obstacles
- [X] Review COVID-Robot: Monitoring Social Distancing Constraints in Crowded Scenarios
- [X] Review SARL: Deep Reinforcement Learning based Human-Aware Navigation for Mobile Robot in Indoor Environments

### This Week: 6 May --> 11 May
- [X] Review the different hardware from the different papers and check which model is avaialble in ROS/ Gazebo 
- [X] Write out the steps required for installing OpenAI ROS and the overall environment for simulation
- [X] Start writing the hardware benchmarking on overleaf

### Next Week: 11 May --> 18 May
