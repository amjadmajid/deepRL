#Deep Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Robots Navigation Airport Settings

## ToDo
- [ ] Read this [paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03841.pdf) thoroughly 
- [ ] Present its advantages and disadvantages 
- [ ] Propose an alternative/modified solution to the problem of Multi-robot
navigation using Deep RL (think of using ES)

## ToDo thesis:
- [ ] Fix the implementation on ubnuntu following some of the links below:
