#Deep Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Robots Navigation Airport Settings

## ToDo
- [ ] Read this [paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03841.pdf) thoroughly 
- [ ] Present its advantages and disadvantages 
- [ ] Propose an alternative/modified solution to the problem of Multi-robot
navigation using Deep RL (think of using ES)

## ToDo thesis:
- [x] Fix the ROS/Gazebo environment on ubnuntu following some of the links below for using Deep learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, navigation algorithms, etc.:

- [x] Test out navigation without collision using SLAM and using Lidar in ROS and Gazebo
- [x] Computer Vision in robotics- Test out image recogntion from a camera attached on a robot in ROS/Gazebo
- [ ] Test out the turtlebot tutorial with Q-learning
- [ ] Test out changing the DRL algorithm 
- [ ] Review the different hardware from the different papers and check which model is avaialble in ROS/ Gazebo
