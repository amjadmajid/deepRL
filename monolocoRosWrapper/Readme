This ros wrapper was developed for the monoloco library which aims to visualize and detect social distancing compliance.<br/>
It is being tested with ROS Noetic and Ubuntu 20.04<br/>
The steps needed to run it are:
1. Download and install ROS noetic
2. Install openpifpaf: `<pip3 install openpifpaf>'
3. Install monoloco: '<pip3 install monoloco>'
4. Create a ROS Workspace: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
5. In order to run the wrapper with a turtlebot robot, we will need to download the turtlebot packages:
  1. cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
  2. git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
  3. git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
  4. cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
  5. git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
6. Clone mybot_gazebo into '<cd ~/catkin_ws/src/>' as well
7. '<cd ~/catkin_ws>' && catkin_make
8. '<export SVGA_VGPU10=0>' (in case you are running on a VM)
9. '<export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle>'
10.'<roslaunch mybot_gazebo breach_detection.launch>'
